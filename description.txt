The Steampunk Mod's aim is to bring a steampunk theme to terrraria, from brass to cogs to everything!
Right now this is a W.I.P. mod, so everything is subject to change.
Right now this mod adds a few items and tiles and 1 new boss, more content will be released daily or weekly depending on how much I have done.
Also shoutout to my friend LuckieWolfPaws who will be helping me with spriting the entire mod!
